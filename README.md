# gomockcmp

A simple comparison of common patterns of handwritten mocks in Go and how
gomock can simplify them.

This small project was made to demonstrate to a few people how gomock could
improve the usage of mocks when testing certain projects.

The package structure is as follows:
- `external`: simulates the API of a client for an external service.
- `internal/mock`: the mocks we are comparing: handwritten vs. autogenerated.
- `internal/sync`: our code and the tests for it.
